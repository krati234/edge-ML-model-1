# edge-ML-model#
I have created a machine  learning model using the edge technology in which i have used arduino nano chip on the model for deployment
it has two models , model 1 is of yes , no , noise commands which is sensed yhrough the arduino nano ble chip
the other model predicts the motion and stllness of the object through the arduino nano ble chip.
